            <div>
                <p>With a hybrid work schedule, it can be hard to see who is working, 
                    but now with OOTO I know that my team is hard at work wherever they are.
                </p>

                <h4>Regional Manager</h4>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>My manager always forgets when I am traveling in a different timezone for work. 
                    Now with OOTO I do not get calls in the middle of the night!
                </p>
                <h3>Jim</h3>
                <h4>International Paper Salesman</h4>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>I broke my leg which meant I had to be on short-term disability. 
                    With OOTO my team can tell the difference between when I am on sick leave not working, 
                    vs. when I am working from home.
                </p>
